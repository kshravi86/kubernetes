Kubernetes (K8s) 🌟 is an open-source system for managing [containerized applications] 📦 across multiple hosts 🖥️🖥️🖥️. It provides basic mechanisms for deployment 🚀, maintenance 🛠️, and scaling 📈 of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google 🏢 running production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg] 🤖, combined with best-of-breed ideas 💡 and practices from the community 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]) ☁️. If your company 🏢 wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged 🥡, dynamically scheduled 🗓️, and microservices-oriented 🧩, consider joining the CNCF 🎉. For details about who's involved and how Kubernetes plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement] 📢.

## 🏁 To start using K8s 🏁

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io] 📚.

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes] 🎓.

To use Kubernetes code as a library 📚 in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md) 🧩. Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported 🚫.

## 💻 To start developing K8s 💻

The [community repository] 🤝 hosts all information about building Kubernetes from source 🛠️, how to contribute code 📝 and documentation 📄, who to contact about what 📞, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment] 🟢.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment] 🐳.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```

For the full story 📖, head over to the [developer's documentation] 👨‍💻.

## 🗓️ Community Meetings 🗓️

The [Calendar](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) 📅 has the list of all the meetings in the Kubernetes community in a single location.

## 🌟 Adopters 🌟

The [User Case Studies](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/) 📖 website has real-world use cases of organizations across industries that are deploying/migrating to Kubernetes.

## 🏛️ Governance 🏛️

The Kubernetes project is governed by a framework of principles 📜, values ❤️, policies ⚖️ and processes ⚙️ to help our community and constituents towards our shared goals 🎯.

The [Kubernetes Community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 is the launching point for learning about how we organize ourselves.

The [Kubernetes Steering community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering) 🧭 is used by the Kubernetes Steering Committee, which oversees governance of the Kubernetes project.

## 🗺️ Roadmap 🗺️

The [Kubernetes Enhancements repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) ✨ provides information about Kubernetes releases 릴, as well as feature tracking 🛤️ and backlogs 📚.
